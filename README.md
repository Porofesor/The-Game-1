# ⚔️ Warcraft 3-Inspired Game (WIP)

This is an **very early-stage** project where I'm attempting to **replicate my own simple version** of **Warcraft 3** and take inspiration from the mod **Lordaeron: The Aftermath**. Right now, the project is focused on setting up the **basic UI** and **game structure** in **TypeScript**.

## 🎯 Future Features to add
 
✅ **Basic UI Panels**  
✅ **Minimap Display**  
✅ **Interface Elements**  
✅ **Main Menu**  
✅ **Map Grid System**  
✅ **Initial Game Classes**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **TypeScript** – Main programming language  
- **HTML5 & CSS** – UI layout  
- **Canvas/WebGL** – (Planned for rendering)  
- **(More to come...)**  

## 📌 Project Status

🚧 **This project is still in its early stages.** Right now, the focus is on building the core UI and game foundation before implementing actual gameplay mechanics.  

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Implement **game entities (units, buildings, abilities)**  
- Develop **real-time strategy (RTS) mechanics**  
- Add **multiplayer support in far future**
- Add **AI bots for single player**
- Improve **graphics and animations**
